    <h1>Welcome to Walking Robot Simulation</h1>
    This problem has been taken from <a href = "https://leetcode.com/problems/walking-robot-simulation/description/">LeetCode</a>.
    According to the problem, a robot is initially positioned at (0,0), facing north.
    The problem requires two sets of input data :
    <ul>
      <li>Instruction which is received by the robot
        <ul>
          <li>-1 : instructs robot to turn right by 90 degrees</li>
          <li>-2 : instructs robot to turn left by 90 degrees</li>
          <li>1&lt;=x&lt;=9 : instructs robot to move forward by x units</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Set of obstacles positions (integral coordinates), which may halt the robot movement</li>
    </ul>
    Robot instructions (comma separated list):
    <input type = "text" id = "input" placeholder = "Ex: 2,3,-1,4"/>
    <br>
    Pick one of the following to input robot instructions:
    <br>
    <input type = "radio" name = "input_manually" value = "manual"/>
      Input the data manually
    <br>
    <input type = "radio" name = "input_select" value = "select"/>
      Plot the obstacles on a graph<sup><a href="#restriction">1</a></sup>
